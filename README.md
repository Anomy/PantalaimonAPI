## Petting Directions
### Favorite Petting
* scratched behind the ear like a dog.
* petted under the chin with a straight finger.
* scratched on the top of his back ONLY next to his tail and ONLY if he's not mewing at you.
### Warnings
* Stay aware of him at all times, watch and listen, he will change his mind about wanted to be petted in an instant.
* Pan is very particular about how he's petted. If he meows while being petted, he does NOT want to be petted and will nip as a result.
* Pan has no front claws, but does have back claws and teeth.

## Brushing Directions

* Pan likes being brushed lightly on the top of his back right next to his tail.

## Catbox
* The cat box is located on the far north east side of the apartment in the corner.  If you can't find the cat, that's probably where he is.
* If cleaning the catbox, there are grocery bags underneath the kitchen sink and there is a scoop on top of the cat box. Please take bag with scooped litter to the garbage shoot. The Shoot is located outside our unit and down the hallway. Take a right at the elevator, brief left and it's the door on the right, which has NO apartment letter on it.
